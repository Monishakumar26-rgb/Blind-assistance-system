# Blind-assistance-system
This is a vision enhancer-based module  specifically for the BLIND VICTIMS. The system is designed in such a way in  which the blind person can take the help of an LAPTOP BROWSER which in turn  sends Real Time Frames to the LAPTOP-BASED WIRELESS NETWORKED  SYSTEM. It works on REAL-TIME OBJECT DETECTION using  SSD_MOBILENET algorithm and YOLO MODEL.
